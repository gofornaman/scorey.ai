Scorey
- Scraping, aggregating and assessing technical ability of a candidate based on publicly available sources

Problem Statement
The current interview scenario is biased towards "candidate's performance during the 2 hour interview" and doesn't take other factors into account such as candidate's competitive coding abilities, contribution towards developer community and so on.

Approach
Scorey tries to solve this problem by aggregating publicly available data from various websites such as

* Github
* StackOverflow
* CodeChef
* Codebuddy
* Codeforces
* Hackerearth
* SPOJ
* GitAwards
Once the data is collected, the algorithm then defines a comprehensive scoring system that grades the candidates technical capablities based on following factors

- Ranking
- Number of Problems Solved
- Activity
- Reputation
- Contribution
- Followers
The candidate is then assigned a scored out of 100 
This helps the interviewer get a full view of candidates abilties and therefore helps them make a unbiased, informed decision.
